        <ul>
          <li>Cache Control - allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either requests or responses</li>
          <li>Content media type specification</li>
            <ul>
              <li>HTTP uses Internet Media Types [17] in the Content-Type (section 14.17) and Accept (section 14.1) header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Language and character set specifications</li>
            <ul>
              <li>character set - a method used with one or more tables to convert a sequence of octets into a sequence of characters</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Content/Transfer coding</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has been or can be applied to an entity. Primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed without losing the identity of its underlying media type and without loss of information.</li>
              <li>Transfer-coding values are used to indicate an encoding transformation that has been, can be, or may need to be applied to an entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Content negotiation - process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations available</li>
          <li>Client-server protocol/negotiation</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An HTTP/1.1 server MAY assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including the connection-token "close" was sent in the request.</li>
              <li>An HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but would decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server contains a Connection header with the connection-token close</li>
              <li>Either the client or the server sends the close token in the Connection header, that request becomes the last one for the connection.</li>
              <li>Clients and servers SHOULD NOT assume that a persistent connection is maintained for HTTP versions less than 1.1 unless it is explicitly signaled.</li>
              <li>In order to remain persistent, all messages on the connection MUST have a self-defined message length</li>
            </ul>

          <li>Persistent connection</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes place using the Connection header field (section 14.10). Once a close has been signaled, the client MUST NOT send any more requests on that connection.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Request pipelining</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without waiting for each response, allowing a single TCP connection to be used much more efficiently, with much lower elapsed time.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Authentication/Authorization</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested.</li>
